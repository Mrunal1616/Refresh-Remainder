# Refresh-Remainder

### Idea of the project:
Do you often find yourself sitting in front of the computer screen working for hours together at a stretch? Do you often develop problems like dry eyes, neck pain and shoulder pain at the end of the day? Well then, we have got you covered.
‘Refresh Remainder’ is the perfect solution for you.

Refresh Reminder helps users improve not only their physical health but also their work productivity by tracking their on-screen time and giving them a soft nudge to take timely breaks and guides the users through optimal exercises via our AR model. Further, it notifies them about possible lapses in eye blinking and improper face-to-screen distance. The application can also be accessed by motion gestures thus keeping the user away from their digital devices.


We are building an application where the users can choose between the three features that it will offer primarily. 
Features: 
1. Face-to-Screen Distance: This feature when turned on will detect the distance between the face of the user and the computer screen then the user will be notified about the same. The application will create an intrusive pop up to remind the user. This feature will reduce the changes of neck or shoulder pain. 
2. Blink Detection: This feature will remind the user giving a pop up, if the blinking rate of the person is detected to be very low. This would prevent dry eyes. 
3. Exercise Animation and Work time detection: The application will monitor the user’s work time in the background and will give the user a reminder to take a break, when the
user hasn't taken a break for a defined threshold time. It will give an option to the user to follow some animated exercises.
These being, the primary features of the application, we plan to add gesture navigation to the application.

### Motivation 

With the scenario of work from home, online classes and everything being turned suddenly into screen based workloads, the problems of dry eyes, back pain, shoulder pain, neck pain, and what not has increased. We often find ourselves sitting in front of our computer screens or the mobile screens for a longer period of time and definitely that's not good.

The motivation to build an application to help us remember and help out with the issues caused by long duration of exposure to screens, comes from experiencing it ourselves. With the start of 2020, we have been facing the pandemic and we as students have jumped from an offline mode of learning to online modes, increasing our screen times. This increase in the screen times has undoubtedly caused dry eyes and neck and shoulder pain. We have experienced all of it. And this was the motivation behind the idea of developing an application to monitor the same.
